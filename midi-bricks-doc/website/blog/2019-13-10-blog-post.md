# Fix Slider Scaling Issues

We have found solutions to get the sliders more precise for scaling purposes and furthermore optimized in performance. 

The first fix is concerning about having the full scale of the slider available, even if you have chosen Minvalue = 20 and Maxvalue = 40, for example. Now you have the full height of the slider, which you can move for your performance.

The second fix will take care about, that horizontal sliders will not overlapp with its neighbours.

You can auto-update your app or download new Release: https://github.com/TimSusa/midi-bricks-mono/releases/tag/v1.3.25 manually.
