# Fix for problems, when loading presets

Power user Aleq Troniq complained about problems when loading a new preset. Thanks for that hint.
This should be fixed now with version 1.2.8.

Either update your app or download new Release: https://github.com/TimSusa/midi-bricks/releases/tag/v1.2.8 manually.

See merged PR: https://github.com/TimSusa/midi-bricks/commit/788f55d9e4da34363efa7c6226eca0587e2a3314
