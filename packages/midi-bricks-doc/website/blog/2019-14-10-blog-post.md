# Proof of concept for remote server session

We try to achieve a way to get your local midi-bricks installation connected to other clients arround the world. This feature is experimental. At the Electron-App Site you can enable it in Application Preferences, when expanding the left Menu via Burger.

After that you can create a public URL, which you can give to your clients, to connect to your server.

The client app you can simply reach at: https://midi-bricks.timsusa.now.sh

There you can paste your public URL from MIDI Server to connect your client to the server.

You can auto-update your app or download new Release: https://github.com/TimSusa/midi-bricks-mono/releases/tag/v1.3.26 manually.
