## Just a few words before

This is a multiplatform project, which includes a [Webdeployment](https://midi-bricks.timsusa.now.sh) and installers for all platforms, where acutal releases could always obtained from  [Installer Downloads Page](https://github.com/TimSusa/midi-bricks-mono/releases). Be informed, that installation is only necessary for the first time. After that you can use automatic application updates, which you can turn off.
